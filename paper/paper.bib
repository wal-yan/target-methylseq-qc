    abstract = {Introduction Recurrent wheezing disorders including asthma are complex and heterogeneous diseases that affect up to 30\% of all children, contributing to a major burden on children, their families, and global healthcare systems. It is now recognized that a dysfunctional airway epithelium plays a central role in the pathogenesis of recurrent wheeze, although the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. This prospective birth cohort aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the influence of intrinsic epithelial dysfunction on the risk for developing respiratory disorders and the modulation of this risk by maternal morbidities, in utero exposures, and respiratory exposures in the first year of life.
Methods and Analysis The Airway Epithelium Respiratory Illnesses and Allergy ({AERIAL}) study is nested within the {ORIGINS} Project and will monitor 400 infants from birth to five years. The primary outcome of the {AERIAL} study will be the identification of epithelial endotypes and exposure variables that influence the development of recurrent wheezing, asthma, and allergic sensitisation. Nasal respiratory epithelium at birth to six weeks, one, three, and five years will be analysed by bulk {RNA}-seq and {DNA} methylation sequencing. Maternal morbidities and in utero exposures will be identified on maternal history and their effects measured through transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses of the amnion and newborn epithelium. Exposures within the first year of life will be identified based on infant medical history as well as on background and symptomatic nasal sampling for viral {PCR} and microbiome analysis. Daily temperatures and symptoms recorded in a study-specific Smartphone App will be used to identify symptomatic respiratory illnesses.
Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from Ramsey Health Care {HREC} {WA}-{SA} (\#1908). Results will be disseminated through open-access peer-reviewed manuscripts, conference presentations, and through different media channels to consumers, {ORIGINS} families, and the wider community.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: BioContainers (biocontainers.pro) is an open-source and community-driven framework which provides platform independent executable environments for bioinformatics software. BioContainers allows labs of all sizes to easily install bioinformatics software, maintain multiple versions of the same software and combine tools into powerful analysis pipelines. BioContainers is based on popular open-source projects Docker and rkt frameworks, that allow software to be installed and executed under an isolated and controlled environment. Also, it provides infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage and distribute bioinformatics containers with a special focus on omics technologies. These containers can be integrated into more comprehensive bioinformatics pipelines and different architectures (local desktop, cloud environments or HPC clusters). AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is freely available at github.com/BioContainers/. CONTACT: yperez@ebi.ac.uk.},

    abstract = {Next-generation {DNA} sequencing ({NGS}) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by {NGS}—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit ({GATK}), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation {DNA} sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of {MapReduce}. The {GATK} provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the {GATK} framework for correctness, stability, and {CPU} and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the {GATK} by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) calling. We conclude that the {GATK} programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust {NGS} tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

            Motivation: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify {QC} metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.
            Results: We present {MultiQC}, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. {MultiQC} can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

   abstract = {Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non-bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.},
